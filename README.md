Project Synopsis

Project Title :- Sudoku Solver

Project Description:-The aim is to implementing the Algorithm .Learn how to make sudoku solver with the help of Backtracking Algorithm.Go to demo link ,We will having sudoku which you can fill partially satisfying the condtion that no two same number can be in same box or same column or row.After satisfying all the condition we will make partially sudoku and then when  we will click on the solve button with the help of our backtracking Algorithm will generate all the possible answer that we can have with satisfying the condition and  return one of them to us.This is how project work.The partial field sudoku was filled completely with the help of our backtracking algorithm.Many more online games are based on algorithm that we can get better exposure about them working on this project.


Technology:- Html,Css,Javascript ,Backtracking Algorithm.
